Some notes on getpeaks:

- When dealing with a new structure, it is a good idea to try different values
  for the histogram settings, especially the distance cutoff. If there are
  additional molecules just beyond the cutoff, this may cause problems later
  when doing finite-temperature averaging using cryststat (the molecules
  may move within the cutoff and contribute to the statistics of the wrong peak).

- The norm cutoff used to trim the histogram should be larger for a less
  ordered system, but it is a good idea to try smaller values to make sure
  that physically distinct peaks are not getting merged into a single peak.

- There is only a limited treatment of point-group molecular symmetry in this
  version of the library, for symmetries other than the ones implemented the
  statistics will still be correct, but there will be a multiplicity of
  symmetry-equivalent peaks.
