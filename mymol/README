mymol - A simple C++ molecular modeling library

mymol provides a set of classes to store and manipulate the types of objects
commonly found in molecular modeling - atoms, bonds, geometries (collections
of atoms and bonds), molecules, and various molecular file formats.

To build the library, simply run 'make' from the 'mymol' directory.

For details, check the header files in the 'mymol/include' directory.

To debug the library, modify the file 'src/mymol.cpp', and then use
'make debug'. The debug executable will be created in the 'bin' directory.
