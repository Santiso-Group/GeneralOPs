The files in this directory are taken from the randomc package by Agner Fog. 
All I did was add a Makefile. The package is (c) Agner Fog - 
see src/rancombi.cpp for more details.
Note that randomc is covered by a GNU GPL, so if you intend to use this in
a commercial package you will need to implement your own version of the
random number generators in order to link to the crystdist library
(or you can use the RNGs that come with the C++11 standard library)
The original distribution of randomc can be found at http://www.agner.org/random/
and in the file randomc.zip in this directory.
